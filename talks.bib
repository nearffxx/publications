  abstract      = {Modern botnets rely on domain-generation algorithms (DGAs)
                  to build resilient command-and-control infrastructures.
                  Recent works focus on recognizing automatically generated
                  domains (AGDs) from DNS traffic, which potentially allows to
                  identify previously unknown AGDs to hinder or disrupt
                  botnets' communication capabilities. The state-of-the-art
                  approaches require to deploy low-level DNS sensors to access
                  data whose collection poses practical and privacy issues,
                  making their adoption problematic. We propose a mechanism
                  that overcomes the above limitations by analyzing DNS traffic
                  data through a combination of linguistic and IP-based
                  features of suspicious domains. In this way, we are able to
                  identify AGD names, characterize their DGAs and isolate
                  logical groups of domains that represent the respective
                  botnets. Moreover, our system enriches these groups with new,
                  previously unknown AGD names, and produce novel knowledge
                  about the evolving behavior of each tracked botnet. We used
                  our system in real-world settings, to help researchers that
                  requested intelligence on suspicious domains and were able to
                  label them as belonging to the correct botnet automatically.
                  Additionally, we ran an evaluation on 1,153,516 domains,
                  including AGDs from both modern (e.g., Bamital) and
                  traditional (e.g., Conficker, Torpig) botnets. Our approach
                  correctly isolated families of AGDs that belonged to distinct
                  DGAs, and set automatically generated from non-automatically
                  generated domains apart in 94.8 percent of the cases.},

  eventtitle    = {Hek.si},
  abstract      = {Two-factor authentication is widely used by high-value
                  services to prevent adversaries from compromising accounts
                  using stolen credentials. Facebook has recently released a
                  two-factor authentication mechanism, referred to as Social
                  Authentication, which requires users to identify some of
                  their friends in randomly selected photos. A recent study has
                  provided a formal analysis of social authentication
                  weaknesses against attackers inside the victim's social
                  circles. In this paper, we extend the threat model and study
                  the attack surface of social authentication in practice, and
                  show how any attacker can obtain the information needed to
                  solve the challenges presented by Facebook. We implement a
                  proof-of-concept system that utilizes widely available face
                  recognition software and cloud services, and evaluate it
                  using real public data collected from Facebook. Under the
                  assumptions of Facebook's threat model, our results show that
                  an attacker can obtain access to (sensitive) information for
                  at least 42\% of a user's friends that Facebook uses to
                  generate social authentication challenges. By relying solely
                  on publicly accessible information, a casual attacker can
                  solve 22\% of the social authentication tests in an automated
                  fashion, and gain a significant advantage for an additional
                  56\% of the tests, as opposed to just guessing. Additionally,
                  we simulate the scenario of a determined attacker placing
                  himself inside the victim's social circle by employing dummy
                  accounts. In this case, the accuracy of our attack greatly
                  increases and reaches 100\% when 120 faces per friend are
                  accessible by the attacker, even though it is very accurate
                  with as little as 10 faces.},

                  discusses the results of a research that we have conducted
                  about the impact on users of short URLs. I describe a system
                  that we designed, implemented, and deployed that observes and
                  collects the short URLs that more than 7,000 real web users
                  have encountered while browsing the Web between March 2010
                  and April 2011 (and counting). On this dataset, which
                  comprises 16,075,693 distinct short URLs, we first precisely
                  characterized the usage habits observed during our collection
                  process, and the content typically referred by short URLs:
                  Users exhibit different usage habits depending on the type of
                  content they are using short URLs for. We then analyzed the
                  abuse of short URLs to hide the true URL of malicious pages:
                  This practice is not widespread, although we noticed that the
                  miscreants tend to post the same malicious short URL on
                  multiple pages. Finally, we analyzed the countermeasures of
                  shortening services against abuses of short URLs, and found
                  that they are trivially bypassed by shortening a benign URL
                  that turns malicious only a few moments after submitting it
                  to the shortening service.},
