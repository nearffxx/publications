  abstract      = {Cross-device tracking (XDT) technologies are currently the
                  ``Holy Grail'' for marketers because they allow to track the
                  user's visited content across different devices to then push
                  relevant, more targeted content. For example, if a user
                  clicks on a particular advertisement while browsing the web
                  at home, the advertisers are very interested in collecting
                  this information to display, later on, related advertisements
                  on other devices belonging to the same user (e.g., phone,
                  tablet).
                  
                  Currently, the most recent innovation in this area is
                  ultrasonic cross-device tracking (uXDT), which is the use of
                  the ultrasonic spectrum as a communication channel to "pair"
                  devices for the aforementioned tracking purposes.
                  Technically, this pairing happens through a receiver
                  application installed on the phone or tablet. The business
                  model is that users will receive rewards or useful services
                  for keeping those apps active, pretty much like it happens
                  for proximity-marketing apps (e.g., Shopkick), where users
                  receive deals for walk-ins recorded by their
                  indoor-localizing apps.
                  
                  This talk will describe and demonstrate the practical
                  security and privacy risks that arise with the adoption of
                  uXDT-enabled systems. The uXDT technology has caught the
                  attention of major companies (e.g., IDG Ventures, Google,
                  Nestle, Dominos), many of which either invested in uXDT
                  providers (e.g., SilverPush, Signal360, Audible Magic), or
                  approached such companies as clients. Unfortunately,
                  unbeknownst to the users, we found that numerous mobile
                  applications, some with millions of downloads, include uXDT
                  advertising frameworks that actively listen for ultrasounds,
                  with no opt-out option for the users! Security experts and
                  the authorities (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission) have
                  promptly raised concerns about uXDT, but until now no
                  comprehensive security analysis of the technology has been
                  released.
                  
                  In this talk, we will explore the uXDT ecosystem, dig into
                  the inner workings of popular uXDT frameworks, and perform an
                  in-depth technical analysis of the underlying technology,
                  exposing both implementation \& design vulnerabilities, and
                  critical security \& privacy shortcomings that we discovered.
                  In the offensive part of our talk, we will demonstrate
                  (through practical demo sessions) how an attacker can exploit
                  uXDT frameworks to reveal the true IP addresses of users who
                  browse the Internet through anonymity networks (e.g., VPNs or
                  Tor). Moreover, we will describe how an attacker can tamper
                  with the "pairing" process or affect the results of the
                  advertising/bidding algorithms. For example, an attacker
                  equipped with a simple beacon-emitting device (e.g., a
                  smartphone) can walk into a Starbucks at peak hour and launch
                  a profile-corruption attack against all customers currently
                  taking advantage of uXDT-enabled apps.
                  
                  In the defensive part of our talk, we will introduce three
                  countermeasures that we designed, implemented, and will
                  publicly release. These include (1) a mobile application that
                  detects ultrasound beacons "in the air" with the goal of
                  raising awareness, (2) a browser extension that acts as a
                  personal firewall by selectively filtering ultrasonic
                  beacons, and (3) an brand-new OS permission control in
                  Android that allows applications to declaratively ask access
                  to the ultrasound spectrum. We will go into the technical
                  details and provide remediation advice useful both for the
                  users and developers.},

                  in the Cat-Mouse Game}},
  eventtitle    = {{Blackhat Europe}},
  abstract      = {While we have grown accustomed to stealthy malware,
                  specifically written to gain and maintain control of the
                  victim machines to abuse their resources, ransomware really
                  comes as a "plot twist"! After 10+ years of stealthy malware,
                  spread mainly for building botnets and steal information, for
                  the second time we're witnessing a growth of disruptive
                  malware, and an interest for direct and fast profit.
                  Ransomware is a particularly striking example of disruptive
                  malware, both on mobile and desktop targets: While
                  traditional mass malware must fly under the radar to fulfill
                  its goals, a ransomware attack that remains unaccountable has
                  failed miserably. It must show up to inform and frighten the
                  victim! As a result, the human psychological response to the
                  attack plays a significant role in the success of ransomware
                  schemes. And, given the remarkable revenue, the scheme seems
                  to be working fairly well.
                  
                  This talk will describe the technical impact of disruptive
                  malware and its game-changing approach, which made us (at
                  least) rethink our incident-response plans. We will focus on
                  mobile ransomware as a representative, extreme case study.
                  Albeit not very studied, we are currently tracking 10
                  distinct families, and collected tenths of thousands distinct
                  samples in three months. In this talk, we will go through the
                  most notorious families such as Koler, SLocker, Svpeng (and
                  mention the other notable ones), overviewing their
                  social-engineering tricks and how they are technically
                  implemented. This will include, for instance, how an app can
                  effectively lock a device to forcefully display the typical
                  threatening message that informs the victim of what just
                  happened, or how crypto and file-system APIs are (ab)used to
                  surreptitiously encrypt the valuable data.
                  
                  After having overviewed these aspects, we will describe how
                  they can be effectively detected with specific static
                  features. We will present a lightweight Smali emulator to
                  track the instruction sequences that implement device-locking
                  mechanisms. To detect malicious encryption attempts, we will
                  present a static, dataflow-based program-analysis technique
                  and tool that track file-system operations (e.g., file
                  listing, file reading) to determine if they are "connected"
                  to encryption flows. Since the most recent families have
                  started to abuse the device-administration API (e.g., to lock
                  the device), obfuscated method names and reflection to hinder
                  automatic static analysis, we will show a couple of
                  counter-tricks. Last, we will show how the threatening
                  messages can be recognized from normal text using a
                  language-analysis technique, which classifies text based on
                  the appearance of key terms frequently found in ransomware
                  samples but not in benign sources. Since static
                  program-analysis approaches like ours can be time and
                  resource consuming, we describe a fast triaging pre-filtering
                  technique to quickly discard strikingly benign applications.
                  This filter is generic and ransomware-agnostic. Thus, in
                  principle, it could be applied to any app-vetting pipeline.
                  
                  With this talk we will release the source code of a prototype
                  that implements (part of) the described techniques, and a
                  dataset comprising tenths of thousands of ransomware
                  applications targeting the Android platform, each labeled
                  with the set of features that characterize their
                  statically-extracted behavior.},

  abstract      = {Modern botnets rely on domain-generation algorithms (DGAs)
                  to build resilient command-and-control infrastructures.
                  Recent works focus on recognizing automatically generated
                  domains (AGDs) from DNS traffic, which potentially allows to
                  identify previously unknown AGDs to hinder or disrupt
                  botnets' communication capabilities. The state-of-the-art
                  approaches require to deploy low-level DNS sensors to access
                  data whose collection poses practical and privacy issues,
                  making their adoption problematic. We propose a mechanism
                  that overcomes the above limitations by analyzing DNS traffic
                  data through a combination of linguistic and IP-based
                  features of suspicious domains. In this way, we are able to
                  identify AGD names, characterize their DGAs and isolate
                  logical groups of domains that represent the respective
                  botnets. Moreover, our system enriches these groups with new,
                  previously unknown AGD names, and produce novel knowledge
                  about the evolving behavior of each tracked botnet. We used
                  our system in real-world settings, to help researchers that
                  requested intelligence on suspicious domains and were able to
                  label them as belonging to the correct botnet automatically.
                  Additionally, we ran an evaluation on 1,153,516 domains,
                  including AGDs from both modern (e.g., Bamital) and
                  traditional (e.g., Conficker, Torpig) botnets. Our approach
                  correctly isolated families of AGDs that belonged to distinct
                  DGAs, and set automatically generated from non-automatically
                  generated domains apart in 94.8 percent of the cases.},

  abstract      = {Two-factor authentication is widely used by high-value
                  services to prevent adversaries from compromising accounts
                  using stolen credentials. Facebook has recently released a
                  two-factor authentication mechanism, referred to as Social
                  Authentication, which requires users to identify some of
                  their friends in randomly selected photos. A recent study has
                  provided a formal analysis of social authentication
                  weaknesses against attackers inside the victim's social
                  circles. In this paper, we extend the threat model and study
                  the attack surface of social authentication in practice, and
                  show how any attacker can obtain the information needed to
                  solve the challenges presented by Facebook. We implement a
                  proof-of-concept system that utilizes widely available face
                  recognition software and cloud services, and evaluate it
                  using real public data collected from Facebook. Under the
                  assumptions of Facebook's threat model, our results show that
                  an attacker can obtain access to (sensitive) information for
                  at least 42\% of a user's friends that Facebook uses to
                  generate social authentication challenges. By relying solely
                  on publicly accessible information, a casual attacker can
                  solve 22\% of the social authentication tests in an automated
                  fashion, and gain a significant advantage for an additional
                  56\% of the tests, as opposed to just guessing. Additionally,
                  we simulate the scenario of a determined attacker placing
                  himself inside the victim's social circle by employing dummy
                  accounts. In this case, the accuracy of our attack greatly
                  increases and reaches 100\% when 120 faces per friend are
                  accessible by the attacker, even though it is very accurate
                  with as little as 10 faces.},

                  Royal Holloway University of London, in April 2012. This talk
                  discusses the results of a research that we have conducted
                  about the impact on users of short URLs. I describe a system
                  that we designed, implemented, and deployed that observes and
                  collects the short URLs that more than 7,000 real web users
                  have encountered while browsing the Web between March 2010
                  and April 2011 (and counting). On this dataset, which
                  comprises 16,075,693 distinct short URLs, we first precisely
                  characterized the usage habits observed during our collection
                  process, and the content typically referred by short URLs:
                  Users exhibit different usage habits depending on the type of
                  content they are using short URLs for. We then analyzed the
                  abuse of short URLs to hide the true URL of malicious pages:
                  This practice is not widespread, although we noticed that the
                  miscreants tend to post the same malicious short URL on
                  multiple pages. Finally, we analyzed the countermeasures of
                  shortening services against abuses of short URLs, and found
                  that they are trivially bypassed by shortening a benign URL
                  that turns malicious only a few moments after submitting it
                  to the shortening service.},
